SURGEON: John Doe, DMD 
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position. After satisfactory level of general anesthesia had been administered by nasotracheal intubation, a 4 x 4 gauze throat pack was placed and the following dental procedures were then carried out based upon a thorough oral examination and radiographs. The upper left first and second primary molars, the lower left second primary molar and the lower right first and second primary molars were excavated of caries and prepared to receive stainless steel crowns. Prior to crown placement, a pulpotomy was performed on the upper left second primary molar, the lower left second primary molar and the lower right first primary molar. Crowns were then closely fitted to these teeth and cemented with FujiCEM cement. All four first permanent molars, the upper left primary canine and the lower right primary canine were excavated of caries and restored with light-bonded Z100. The upper primary central and laterals, the upper right first and second primary molars, both lower primary laterals, and the lower left first primary molar were then extracted by means of elevator and forceps. Gelfoam was placed in the sockets and tissue was closely approximated and sutured with 3-0 chromic suture. Prophylaxis with topical fluoride was then applied. The mouth was suctioned, throat pack removed and the patient then taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.
