SURGEON: John Doe, DMD 
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the OR after being given IM ketamine and IV was started on the left hand. The patient was intubated through the left naris. The patient was maintained on nitrous oxide, oxygen and sevoflurane. Sterile drapes were placed in the usual manner. The patient’s oropharynx and mouth were irrigated and thoroughly suctioned and a thin moist throat pack was placed. Full mouth set of dental x-rays were taken revealing no interproximal decay, but slight to moderate periodontal disease. Fractures were noted on tooth numbers 10 and 26. A thorough periodontal curettage was undertaken to eliminate calculus and debris that accumulate around the gingival crevice. Prophylaxis with fluoride treatment was given. Teeth numbers 10 and 26 were extracted. The apical root portions were left, as they appeared to be resorbing into the bone. Two 4-0 gut sutures were placed. Hemorrhage was easily controlled. Estimated blood loss was minimal. The throat pack was removed. The patient was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room. The patient’s condition was good during the recovery. The prognosis for the remaining dentition is guarded. The patient will eventually be in need of full mouth extractions. The patient is to be discharged with instructions including activity, diet and medications. The patient will be seen in one week for postoperative evaluation.
