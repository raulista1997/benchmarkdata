Vascular Surgery SOAP Note Sample Report #3 
SUBJECTIVE: The patient returns with recurrent varicose veins in her left leg. We did bilateral ligation and stripping of branch varicose veins 10 years ago. Six years ago, she had bilateral recurrence. Three years ago, she underwent bilateral stab phlebectomy again. The patient said she had done well until about a year ago when she started developing recurrences on her left leg only. They cause stinging and burning. She has worn sports stocking, but they do not help. These are 20 and 30 mmHg compression stockings of both knee high and thigh high. The patient has been wearing this for the last six months. The symptoms are getting worse and the size and number of the varicosities has also worsened. 
OBJECTIVE: On exam, the right leg is normal. The left leg has normal pulses with no skin changes. There are bulging tortuous varicosities on her anterior, lateral, and medial thigh and leg. These are 5 to 8 mm in diameter. The greater saphenous vein is not palpable or visible. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: We discussed the treatment options again. We discussed stab phlebectomy as the best option. We think these are too many and too large for sclerotherapy.
